/**
 * Effect that creates and returns a configured MysqlDialect.
 *
 * Reads configuration from environment (via Config.*) using the following keys:
 * - `STUDIOCMS_MYSQL_DATABASE` (string)
 * - `STUDIOCMS_MYSQL_HOST` (string)
 * - `STUDIOCMS_MYSQL_PORT` (number)
 * - `STUDIOCMS_MYSQL_USER` (redacted string)
 * - `STUDIOCMS_MYSQL_PASSWORD` (redacted string)
 *
 * The effect constructs a connection pool using createPool and passes it to a new MysqlDialect.
 * The pool is created with the provided database, host, port, and credentials, and uses a
 * connectionLimit of 10. Credentials are unwrapped with Redacted.value before being supplied
 * to the pool.
 *
 * The returned value is an Effect which, when executed, will either fail if any required
 * configuration is missing or invalid, or succeed with a MysqlDialect instance wired to the pool.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The effect is lazy: resources (the pool) are created only when the effect is executed.
 * - Consumer code is responsible for any lifecycle management of the pool/dialect if required.
 *
 * @returns An Effect that resolves to a configured MysqlDialect ready for use with Kysely.
