StudioCMS is a dedicated [SSR (Server-side-rendered)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) Astro native CMS, build from the ground up for the Astro community and by Astro community members. StudioCMS is designed to be a flexible CMS that can be used headless using our RESTAPI or as a fully integrated CMS using plugins and a custom frontend.
