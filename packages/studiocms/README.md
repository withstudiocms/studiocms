# Introducing StudioCMS: A Community-Driven CMS for Astro DB

As part of our efforts, we're excited to introduce StudioCMS - a dedicated content management system (CMS) built on top of Astro's latest feature, [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/). This project was developed by [Adam](https://github.com/Adammatthiesen), [Dreyfus](https://github.com/dreyfus92), and [Jumper](https://github.com/jdtjenkins), three passionate members of the Astro community.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is still in early development and it is not yet ready for production use. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for new features, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/withstudiocms/studiocms/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub repository.

## Why another CMS?

While Astro's content capabilities are powerful, we recognized a need for a more streamlined and user-friendly CMS solution within the Astro ecosystem. Many Astro users, especially those coming from more traditional CMS backgrounds, have expressed a desire for a dedicated CMS that can seamlessly integrate with Astro projects.

StudioCMS was born out of this need, providing a content management platform that is tailor-made for Astro. By building on top of Astro DB, we're able to offer a CMS experience that feels native to the Astro workflow, making it easier for both developers and content creators to collaborate on Astro-powered projects.

## An Experimental Endeavor

It's important to note that StudioCMS is an experimental project that heavily relies on the `@astrojs/db` package, which is currently in active development and not yet considered stable. As a result, you should expect a significant number of breaking changes as the project continues to evolve.

We believe that by building on the cutting-edge features of Astro DB, we can create a powerful and innovative CMS solution. However, this also means that StudioCMS may not be suitable for mission-critical or production-ready projects at this stage. We encourage you to use caution and thoroughly test the CMS in your own projects before deploying it to a live environment.


## Leveraging the Power of Astro

StudioCMS is built from the ground up to seamlessly integrate with Astro's robust and efficient framework. By harnessing the power of Astro, we've created a CMS solution that aligns perfectly with the Astro ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for building and scaling Astro-powered applications.
