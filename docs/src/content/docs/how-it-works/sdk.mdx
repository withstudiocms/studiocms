# Introduction

StudioCMS is a powerful CMS built for Astro that allows you to manage and serve your content using [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/). It's designed to be easy-to-use and flexible enough to handle any type of content.

Extending StudioCMS is easy too! You can create your own plugins to add new features to StudioCMS.
