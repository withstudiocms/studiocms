# Introduction

StudioCMS is a powerful CMS built for Astro that allows you to manage and serve your content using [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/). It's designed to be easy-to-use and flexible enough to handle any type of content.

Extending StudioCMS is easy too! You can create your own plugins to add new features to StudioCMS.

The StudioCMS integration is the basis for the entire StudioCMS ecosystem. It provides a headless CMS solution for Astro projects, allowing you to manage and serve your content using Astro DB. The following is a breakdown of the StudioCMS integration and its components.
