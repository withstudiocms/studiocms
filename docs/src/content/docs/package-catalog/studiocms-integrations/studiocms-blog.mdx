2. Add `@studiocms/blog` to your astro config file:

   ```ts title="studiocms.config.mjs" ins={2, 6}
   import { defineStudioCMSConfig } from 'studiocms/config';
   import blog from '@studiocms/blog';

    export default defineStudioCMSConfig({
      plugins: [
        blog(),
      ],
    });
   ```
## Usage
