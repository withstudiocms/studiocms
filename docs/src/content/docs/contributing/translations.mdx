StudioCMS is a global project, and we want to make it accessible to everyone. If you are fluent in multiple languages, you can help us translate StudioCMS into your language.

## Dashboard i18n

Current translation status:

<img src="https://i18n.studiocms.dev/widget/studiocms/horizontal-auto.svg" alt="Translation status" />

Visit [our i18n dashboard](https://i18n.studiocms.dev) to help translate StudioCMS into your language. If your language is not listed, you can add it within the dashboard.

If you would prefer to contribute translations directly to the repository, the translations are stored in the [`packages/studiocms_core/src/i18n/translations`](https://github.com/withstudiocms/studiocms/tree/main/packages/studiocms/src/lib/i18n/translations/) directory. You can find the English translations in the [`en-us.json`](https://github.com/withstudiocms/studiocms/blob/main/packages/studiocms/src/lib/i18n/translations/en-us.json) file.

StudioCMS uses [Weblate](https://weblate.org) for managing translations on top of GitHub. If you are new to Weblate, you can find the [Translating using Weblate Guide](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/translating.html#) on their website.

Once the translations have been added, they will be added to the [StudioCMS i18n configuration](https://github.com/withstudiocms/studiocms/blob/main/packages/studiocms/src/lib/i18n/index.ts#L8) and will be available in the next release.

## Documentation

**Coming soon!** We are working on prepping to translate the StudioCMS documentation. If you are interested in helping with this, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://chat.studiocms.dev)
