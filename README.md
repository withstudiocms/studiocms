## Getting Started with our Development Playground

The StudioCMS Playground is intended for usage when developing StudioCMS within the monorepo and should not be used to directly test or host StudioCMS. If your goal is to test our CMS, please use our latest release from [npm](https://npm.im/studiocms).

Steps to get a running playground should be the following:

- Clone the GitHub repository
- Run `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`
- Change `dbStartPage` in the Node playground's [StudioCMS config](./playground/studiocms.config.mts) to `true`.
- Ensure `.env` variables are configured (see [`.env.demo`](./playground/.env.demo) for an example of available environment variables)
- Run the following in this order:
  - `pnpm build:studiocms` - Build the StudioCMS packages (required to get the current table schema for the StudioCMS integration)
  - `pnpm playground:push` - Push to your libSQL database assigned via environment variables
  - `pnpm dev` - Starts the Dev server connected to the linked database (as well as builds all repo packages)

Once that process completes successfully you are ready to navigate to `http://localhost:4321/start` and follow the instructions to get your database initialized.

Once complete, you will be redirected and asked to shut down and change the config option `dbStartPage` to `false`. This enables full functionality of the CMS. You can now restart the dev server with `pnpm dev` to continue working with our development playground.

That will give you the dev environment we work with daily.

To start the playground again, use the command `pnpm dev`.
